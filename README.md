# Image Processing

This is a Python library designed for efficient and easy image processing with OpenGl shaders.  
It work with almost any types of images, including PIL Image, pygame Surface, numpy ndarray, and moderngl texture.  
The library provide a lot of processing filters and effects based on moderngl shaders. It allow you to create fully customized shaders programs writted in GLSL. With simplicity in mind, it lets you create processes that run multiple shaders on the same time.
